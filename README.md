# Hemengo App

This is an Ionic + Angular app prototype I made for school.

It fetches data from the hemengo-api I made at the same time.

What is it 
----------
The whole idea is that you can pickup local farm products orders to several vending machine accross the area.
The user has a dashboard with orders soon to be picked-up and orders already processed (picked-up, canceled...).
To pickup an order the user scan the QR Code printed on the machine. The QR Code must be scanned with the "hemengo-scanner" Android app I also made at the time.
Time was really short so I made a mockup page to simulate the vending-machine pickup process.

What does it look like
