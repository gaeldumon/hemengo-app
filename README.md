# Hemengo App
Ionic/Angular project which retrieve data from the hemengo-api.
The idea is that you can pickup local farm products orders to several vending machine accross the area (Pays-Basque, France).
The user has a dashboard with orders soon to be picked-up and orders already processed (picked-up, canceled...). 
To pickup an order you scan the QR Code (with my hemengo-scanner android app) printed on the machine.
Time was really short so I made a demo page to simulate the pickup path.
